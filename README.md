I'm passionate about code & design. I enjoy making ideas alive.

I try reasoning from the first principles by research on my own. Reading alongside empirical research helps a lot.

I consider myself a pragmatic developer.

I treat life as a game and wish to know more about leveling up.

Give me a quest Â¿
